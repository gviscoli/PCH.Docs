# Weather Station Proof of Concept

Welcome to the open-source [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure) of my proof of concept for implentation of a basic Weather Statio.


## Purpose
The goal of this poc is to experiment with a series of cloud technologies such as Azure IoT Hub and Azure SignalR.


### Azure IoT Hub
IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

### Azure SignalR
